      <h3>Assignment 0 -- 9/21/2016</h2>
      <p>Overall I think this assignment was a very good first step for the class. In this assignment, the HTML was pretty easy to learn. <br>Navigating through Github was pretty rough for me. I solved it by asking my roommate to help me out since we are in the same class and he understands Github a lot more than I do currently. <br>I learned about Git clone, more in depth on git pushing, and git pull. I already knew about Git commit, git add, and the basics of git push. I used w3 schools to help me with the HTML, and then my roommate to help me with the Github things.
