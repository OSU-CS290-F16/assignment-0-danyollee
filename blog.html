  <p2>In this assignment, the HTML was pretty easy to learn. But nagivating through Github was pretty rough for me. I solved it by asking my roommate to help me out since we are in the same class and he understands Github a lot more than I do currently. I learned about Git clone, more in depth on git pushing, and git pull. I already knew about Git commit, git add, and the basics of git push. I used w3 schools to help me with the HTML, and then my roommate to help me with the Github things.
